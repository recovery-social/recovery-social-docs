## Abstract

With the LSP11 - Social Recovery Contract a user is able to regain access after losing access to his/her UP.

To do that the user can add different guardians who vote for a his new address to regain access.

A user is able to add Guardians like family members or friends.
But a user don‚Äôt just wants to have friends and family members as guardians.
Users should be able to authenticate themselves with 2FA, Social Logins or even Biometric authentification.

For this we created the LSP11 - Recovery Service Contract, which allows external operators to act as Guardians for the LSP 11 - Social Recovery in a standardized way.

With recovery.social, we offer a UI, which helps the user setup everything and interact with Recovery Services.

We also provide sample projects and docs on how to become a Recovery Service and how to communicate with the LSP11 - Recovery Service and recovery.social.

Our vision is to build an open ecosystem where anyone can build a Recovery Service. The user decides, which services he trusts to help recover his profile.
Because the number of guards (threshold), which are needed to recover, can be set individually so a user don't has to trust one service alone. This makes the system very flexible and trustworthy.
